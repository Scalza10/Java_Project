# Term Project for Intro to Java
This is my term project which consits of simple videogame created in Java fx.

## Motivation for this project

The Motivation for this project was to explore different techniques that were learned during the first part of the summer term in class. Some of these techniques were are also researched and found outside the course material for a deeper understanding of Java fx capabilites.
